# single-page-react-app

## what's this?
This are my first attempts using ES6 (via babel), react, react-router to build a single-page
application. I hope it will serve as a nice template...

## how to use it?
```
git clone https://github.com/danbim/single-page-react-app.git && \
 cd single-page-react-app && \
 npm install && \
 grunt build && \
 node server.js
```

## TODOs

 * incremental builds
 * auto-reload on server
 * query-url component reload
 * use flux?

## any license?
